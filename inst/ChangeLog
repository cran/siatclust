siatclust (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplify directory structure for the package.
  
  * Introduce maxrestart to control the number of restarts when there are
    fewer clusters than requested.
  
  * Remove empty clusters from the returned clustering, as might happen
    when fewer than the requested clusters were found and the maximum
    iteration and maximum number of restarts were reached.
  
  * Add tests for automated testing.

siatclust (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add some basic testing to the package: make tests.
  
  * Random seed functionality working in harmony with R. Thus set.seed in
    R will ensure the same model is built.
  
  * Previous version could return emtpy clusters. This version will
    restart the algorithm when empty clusters are encountered. The number
    of restarts is returned along with the total number of iterations.
